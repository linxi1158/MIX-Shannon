## ✈️ Introduction

**MIX-Shannon** is a project that explores new tasks in the field of multi-modalities, such as Further  Referring Expression Comprehension (**FREC**), Agent Interaction Visual Question Answering (**AI-VQA**), and Cooking-step-images Retrieval  (**CSI-Recipe**). Currently, only the code for the CSI-Recipe task has been made publicly available.
